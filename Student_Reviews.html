    <pre><em>   A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.
I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February.
My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at
Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new
concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.
        
I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at
Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for 
students from all domains to understand the concepts and 
technology taught by the trainers.
        
Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature 
with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me 
a lot in securing this job.
        
Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me 
acquire this opportunity.</em></pre>
